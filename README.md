# Deep-Research-AI-Agentic-System
A Deep Research AI Agentic System using LangChain and LangGraph for online information gathering and answer drafting. Utilizes a dual-agent system for efficient data collection and response generation.


# Deep Research AI Agentic System

## Overview
This project is a Deep Research AI Agentic System designed to gather research data from online sources and draft answers based on the collected information. It utilizes LangChain and LangGraph frameworks for organizing and processing the information. The system uses agents: one for data collection and the other for drafting answers.

## Features
- Crawls websites and gathers information (you can extend it for web crawling).
- Dual-agent system for data gathering and answer drafting.
- Utilizes LangChain and LangGraph for organizing and generating responses.
